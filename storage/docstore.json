In fact, it refers to the dynamic, effortless, and unselfconscious state of mind of a person who is optimally active and effective. People in wu-wei feel as if they are doing nothing, while at the same time they might be creating a brilliant work of art, smoothly negotiating a complex social situation, or even bringing the entire world into harmonious order. For a person in wu-wei, proper and effective conduct follows as automatically as the body gives in to the seductive rhythm of a song. This state of harmony is both complex and holistic, involving as it does the integration of the body, the emotions, and the mind. If we have to translate it, wu-wei is probably best rendered as something like \u201ceffortless action\u201d or \u201cspontaneous action.\u201d Being in wu-wei is relaxing and enjoyable, but in a deeply rewarding way that distinguishes it from cruder or more mundane pleasures. In many respects, it resembles the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s well-known concept of \u201cflow,\u201d or the idea of being in the zone, but with important\u2014and revealing\u2014differences that we will explore. People who are in wu-wei have de, typically translated as \u201cvirtue,\u201d \u201cpower,\u201d or \u201ccharismatic power.\u201d De is radiance that others can detect, and it serves as an outward signal that one is in wu-wei. (Location\u00a0221)\n- The goal is to acquire the ability to move through the physical and social world in a manner that is completely spontaneous and yet fully in harmony with the proper order of the natural and human worlds (the Dao or \u201cWay\u201d). Because of this focus on knowing how rather than knowing this or that, the Chinese tradition has spent a great deal of energy over the past two thousand years exploring the interior, psychological feel of wu-wei, worrying about the paradox at the heart of it, and developing a variety of behavioral techniques to get around it. The ideal person in early China is more like a well-trained athlete or cultivated artist than a dispassionate cost-benefit analyzer. This better fits both our intuitive sense of what real human excellence looks like and our best current scientific understanding of how the mind works. (Location\u00a0323)\n- The ideal person in Western philosophy is not only disembodied but also radically alone. (Location\u00a0332)\n- For the past couple hundred years in the West, the dominant view of human nature has been that we are all individual agents pursuing our own self-interest, responsive only to objective rewards and punishments. (Location\u00a0332)\n- Human societies, according to this narrative, were formed when lone hunter-gatherers\u2014typically men, suspiciously unaccompanied by their mates, children, elderly parents, or sick friends\u2014met in a clearing, negotiated the rules they would live under, and then shook hands and agreed to cooperate. As economists and political scientists have only recently begun to realize, this is a fairy tale cooked up over the last century or two by a bunch of elite, landowning males\u2014what the philosopher Annette Baier has scathingly referred to as \u201ca collection of clerics, misogynists, and puritan bachelors.\u201d (Location\u00a0334)\n- In reality, we are not autonomous, self-sufficient, purely rational individuals but emotional pack animals, intimately dependent on other human beings at every stage of our lives. We get along, not because we\u2019re good at calculating costs and benefits, but because we are emotionally bound to our immediate family and friends and have been trained to adopt a set of values that allows us to cooperate spontaneously with others in our society.

(Location\u00a0364)\n- The best way to ensure that agreements are honored is to forge intense personal loyalties, typically over the course of several evenings fueled by good food and staggering quantities of alcohol. (Location\u00a0365)\n- We have been taught to believe that the best way to achieve our goals is to reason about them carefully and strive consciously to reach them. Unfortunately, in many areas of life this is terrible advice. Many desirable states\u2014happiness, attractiveness, spontaneity\u2014are best pursued indirectly, and conscious thought and effortful striving can actually interfere with their attainment. (Location\u00a0387)\n- A skilled butcher has to change his cleaver once a year, because he cuts; an ordinary butcher has to change his cleaver once a month, because he hacks. As for me, I have been using this particular cleaver for nineteen years now, and have cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet its edge is still as sharp as when it first came off the whetstone. Between the joints of the ox there is space, and the edge of the blade has no thickness; if you use that which has no thickness to pass through gaps where there is space, it\u2019s no problem, there\u2019s plenty of room to let your cleaver play. That\u2019s why, after nineteen years, the edge of my blade looks like it just came from the whetstone. (Location\u00a0417)\n- \u201cWhenever I come to a knot, I see the difficulty ahead, become careful and alert, focus my vision, slow my movements, and move the blade with the greatest subtlety, so that the ox simply falls apart, like a clod of earth falling to the ground.\u201d (Location\u00a0424)\n- we are Butcher Ding\u2019s blade, and the bones and ligaments of the ox are the barriers and obstacles that we face in life. Just as Butcher Ding\u2019s blade remains razor-sharp because it never touches a bone or ligament\u2014moving only through the gaps in between\u2014so does the wu-wei person move only through the open spaces in life, avoiding the difficulties that damage one\u2019s spirit and wear out one\u2019s body. (Location\u00a0428)\n- After I have fasted for three days, concerns about congratulations or praise, titles or stipends no longer trouble my mind. After five days, thoughts of blame or acclaim, skill or clumsiness have also left my mind.

The Net of Heaven covers all; Although its mesh is wide, nothing ever slips through. (Location\u00a0460)\n- the early stages of training, an aspiring Confucian gentleman needs to memorize entire shelves of archaic texts, learn the precise angle at which to bow, and learn the length of the steps with which he is to enter a room. His sitting mat must always be perfectly straight. All of this rigor and restraint, however, is ultimately aimed at producing a cultivated, but nonetheless genuine, form of spontaneity. (Location\u00a0476)\n- \u201cThe Master said, \u2018At fifteen I set my mind upon learning; at thirty I took my place in society; at forty I became free of doubts; at fifty I understood Heaven\u2019s Mandate; at sixty my ear was attuned; and at seventy I could follow my heart\u2019s desires without transgressing the bounds of propriety.\u2019 (Location\u00a0481)\n- In the early Chinese accounts of wu-wei described above, a couple of features are immediately apparent. First, although there is only one Butcher Ding or Confucius in the world, these wu-wei exemplars experience themselves as split. They seem to feel a gap between an \u201cI\u201d (the locus of consciousness and personal identity) and various forces\u2014spiritual desires, desires of the heart\u2014that take over when they enter wu-wei. Wu-wei is characterized by an internal sense of effortlessness and unselfconsciousness, even though the person in wu-wei may actually be very active in the world. Someone or something else must be doing the work besides the conscious mind that we normally think of as \u201cus.\u201d Second, people in wu-wei are extremely effective: huge oxen fall apart with a few swipes of the blade, and complex social situations are negotiated with masterly aplomb. My guess is that we have all experienced this combination of effortlessness and effectiveness at some point in our lives. (Location\u00a0498)\n- \u201cWhen I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years, I no longer saw the ox as a whole. And now\u2014now I meet it with my spirit and don\u2019t look with my eyes.\u201d (Location\u00a0570)\n- These lines appear to describe the act of \u201cseeing\u201d by using different parts of the self. When Butcher Ding is a complete novice, and all he can see is \u201cthe ox itself,\u201d he is merely looking with his eyes, gazing upon this massive, daunting creature that he must somehow reduce to pieces.

(Location\u00a0664)\n- This social dimension of wu-wei becomes crystal clear in texts such as the Analects, where we read that Confucius always appears in the proper attire, knows the right way to enter a room, utters the most apropos words, and deals with others in the most tactful manner, and yet is never stiff or formal. His behavior seems to flow spontaneously from his very nature, which completely disarms philosophical opponents, tames ornery rulers, and shames lazy disciples into pursuing their studies with renewed effort. You can practically hear the swish and swoosh of Ding\u2019s blade as Confucius glides through an official reception with consummate grace or deftly handles a rude interlocutor without missing a beat. (Location\u00a0720)\n- In the Analects we read that \u201cone who rules through the power of de is like the Pole Star: it simply remains in its place and receives the homage of the myriad lesser stars.\u201d (Location\u00a0726)\n- This connection has important implications for understanding the kind of spontaneity that the early Chinese valued so highly. Spontaneity in the West is typically associated with individuality\u2014people just doing whatever they want. Wu-wei, on the other hand, means becoming part of something larger: the cosmic order represented by the Way. Sages from Confucius at age seventy to the Daoists describe wu-wei as a state of \u201cfitting\u201d with the universe. Similarly, de is powerful because Heaven has made humans, animals, and even the natural world in such a way that they respond instantly and unquestioningly to virtue.

You feel clean and happy.\u2026\u00a0Even when you have to work a lot it is very beautiful.\u201d This story has little to do with complexity and challenge, still less with constantly spiraling complexity. Rather, the main sense one gets is of peaceful, relaxed absorption into something larger than the self: the natural beauty of the Italian Alps, an inherited tradition that provides routine and structure, a sense of companionship with animals and birds. These bigger wholes into which Serafina feels absorbed\u2014Nature with a capital \u201cN,\u201d or her cultural tradition\u2014are also seen by her as important sources of value or goodness. Indeed, it is the fact that she deeply cares about her beautiful surroundings and her way of life, and derives meaning from them, that allows her to become absorbed in the first place. When I first read this account, as a beginning student of Chinese thought, I recall feeling that Serafina\u2019s experience not only looked a lot more like early Chinese conceptions of wu-wei than the endless travel and self-improvement of E. but also matched my own experience better. This is a conviction that has only strengthened over time. (Location\u00a0784)\n- Except for the psychological profile of the state they produce, these activities do not look anything at all like E.\u2019s frenetic life. Indeed, if one looks past Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s own emphasis on complexity and challenge, the survey data that he and his colleagues have gathered suggest that most flow experiences actually occur in social situations of relatively low complexity, like conversing with friends, sharing a meal with family, or playing with small children. (Location\u00a0808)\n- Why, then, did flow researchers end up focusing on complexity and challenge as the defining features of the experience? Because these researchers are, for the most part, Western individualists. In our culture, activities like running ultramarathons or exploring new art museums tend to be solitary and aimed at self-improvement. (Location\u00a0812)\n- Flow researchers also latched on to complexity and challenge because they were keen to distinguish flow states from other states that share some of the same features\u2014loss of a sense of self, an altered experience of time, relaxation\u2014but that we wouldn\u2019t want to dignify with the label of \u201cflow.\u201d Watching a mindless TV show would be a good example, but we could include any simple, passive activity that fully occupies our attention while we are immersed in it, yet leaves us feeling empty or tired rather than fulfilled and energized: gambling, reading a trashy magazine, aimlessly surfing the Internet, or exchanging desultory gossip with acquaintances we don\u2019t even really like. When faced with the question of how to distinguish between flow and activities such as this, complexity and challenge jump out as the salient features when considered from a purely individualist perspective.

(Location\u00a0864)\n- trafe (Location\u00a0871)\n- Confucius was convinced that no one was born graceful yet correct, and to the end of his life remained fond of rebuking anyone who thought that untutored casualness was desirable or even socially acceptable. This point is well illustrated by an Analects passage that describes Confucius\u2019s reaction upon entering a room and being welcomed by a young man named Yuan Rang. We don\u2019t know much about this Yuan Rang, but he seems to have been an early Chinese hippie, possibly a devotee of the Laozi we\u2019ll meet in the next chapter. I\u2019ve always imagined him with dreadlocks and loose robes, smelling vaguely of patchouli. Confucius enters the room and finds this guy \u201csitting casually, with his legs sprawled out, waiting for Confucius.\u201d The proper attitude for receiving a guest in a situation like this would have been the formal kneeling posture still practiced by the Japanese: kneeling on a mat while sitting back on the ankles. Yuan Rang was apparently lounging with his legs stretched out or loosely folded in front of him, a position that is certainly more comfortable but rather too casual for receiving an elder such as Confucius. The Master\u2019s response is priceless: \u201cUpon seeing him, the Master remarked, \u2018A young man devoid of humility and respect for his elders will grow into an adult who contributes nothing to his community. Growing older and older without the dignity to simply die, he becomes nothing more than a useless burden.\u2019 He then whacked him on the shin with his staff.\u201d (Location\u00a0949)\n- For them, wu-wei could be obtained only through a lifelong program of trying, strenuously, to distance oneself from nature and move instead toward a thoroughly cultivated kind of perfection. (Location\u00a0965)\n- Another way to put this is that, despite their endorsement of spontaneity as an ultimate end goal, Confucius and Xunzi emphasized cold cognition, on both an individual and a cultural level.

(Location\u00a0975)\n- Knowing how we in fact master a new skill, like driving a car, gives us an important insight into the wu-wei strategy pursued by Confucius and Xunzi. The Confucian Way\u2014the rituals and knowledge passed down from the Zhou dynasty\u2014needs to be fully absorbed by people if they are to live together in a harmonious society. The mind has the power to comprehend the Way, but this is not enough. One needs to get beyond merely understanding the Way and live it, in a fully embodied manner. Cold cognition must be made hot. The Confucians tried to accomplish this by intensively training people\u2019s embodied minds until consciously learned processes could be performed in an wu-wei fashion, like operating a clutch or tying your shoes. (Location\u00a01118)\n- For instance, babies are born with an innate ability to smile in response to pleasure\u2014a simple reflex reaction. It is not until they are a couple months old that they are able to smile at someone, in order to elicit a response or communicate happiness. Later still comes the ability to smile in response to imagined happiness (as in a story) or to the happiness of others (empathetic happiness). This process is often encouraged by stories, art, peer modeling, and literature. (Location\u00a01176)\n- This emphasis on tradition, authority, and collectivism goes very much against Enlightenment thinking. Ren\u00e9 Descartes, in (Location\u00a01197)\n- his Meditations (1641), famously declared that you can\u2019t accept as reliable knowledge what you\u2019ve been taught in school. The only way to obtain true knowledge, he argued, is to acquire it yourself, building up logically from first principles. This is a seductive idea, and very deep-seated in our culture, but it\u2019s almost certainly wrong. To a degree that qualitatively differentiates us from other animals, we are born incomplete, primed to learn specific types of things from our culture but absolutely dependent upon culture to provide them. We celebrate creativity and novelty but tend not to notice the extent to which any artist or business innovator has been shaped by the ideas and efforts of others, both living and dead. There is a trivial sense in which the technological magic worked by Steve Jobs, for instance, depended on preexisting technologies and ideas. There is a more profound sense in which his creativity could have emerged only from the social and cultural milieu of a particular historical moment in Silicon Valley. In this, as in many other respects, the early Confucian view of learning and thinking is probably much more accurate than the one we\u2019ve inherited from the European Enlightenment. (Location\u00a01197)\n- One way to look at this privileging of ancient wisdom over individual brainpower is as a response to the dangers of uncontrolled hot cognition and the inadequacies of individual cold cognition. Because we all have limitations, the Confucians put in place a system of environmental buffers to keep us on the straight and narrow Way.

(Location\u00a01212)\n- Despite all the cultural conservatism, then, the Confucian view of civilized life is, in the end, optimistic. Sigmund Freud, to take a prominent Western counterexample, saw the tension between hot and cold cognition as the ineradicable tragedy at the heart of modern life. We were miserable in the state of nature because a world in which everyone allowed their id\u2014their hot cognition\u2014to run wild would be chaotic, capricious, and brutish, even for the rare individuals lucky enough to be at the top of the social pyramid. A civilized life is better for everyone overall, but it also exacts a cost: everyone is required to either repress or sublimate a large portion of their instinctual drives and to live under the iron rule of cold cognition. The result is a state of what Freud calls Unbehagen, which is usually translated as \u201cdiscontent\u201d or \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d but (Location\u00a01274)\n- also includes a sense of physical unease. If you go into a weird, creepy old house and feel the hair stand up on the back of your neck at the thought of ghosts, that\u2019s also Unbehagen. For Freud, to live as a civilized human being is to live in a creepy old house. (Location\u00a01280)\n- The Confucian ideal of the perfectly civilized person is thus the opposite of the Unbehagen-ridden Freud. The Confucian strategy does try to boost self-control, but mainly it tries to make cold-cognition-approved behavior more reliable by making it \u201cnatural\u201d and spontaneous. The Confucian gentleman is perfectly at home in civilization, instead of always uneasy about it. An evocative passage from the Xunzi describes how Confucian learning can enter the aspiring Confucian and take control of his body, changing his very physiological makeup. \u201cThe learning of the gentleman enters his ear, becomes firm in his heart-mind, spreads out through his four limbs, and manifests itself in both activity and repose. In his merest word, in his slightest movement, the gentleman can always be taken as an example and a model.\u201d At this point there is no more need for cognitive control. Every action of the gentleman is free and easy, yet perfectly correct. \u201cThe sage gives free rein to his desires and fulfills all of his emotions, but having been regulated they accord with civilized norms,\u201d Xunzi explains. \u201cWhat need has he, then, for strength of will, endurance, or cautiousness?\u201d (Location\u00a01282)\n- This is Confucian wu-wei.

Swap out Standing Tall in the Marsh for Moonchild, a human-drawn plow for a homemade composting toilet, and a facility with the Odes for an ability to quote Emerson and Thoreau, and these recluses from the later strata of the Analects would find themselves right at home in 1968 Haight-Ashbury. They are, as far as we know, the original hippies, dropping out, turning on, and stickin\u2019 it to the Man more than two thousand years before the invention of tie-dye and the Grateful Dead. These hippies don\u2019t fare all that well in the Analects itself\u2014as one might expect, in a book compiled by Confucius\u2019s followers, Confucius always gets the last word. All of the \u201cprimitivist\u201d encounters in the Analects end with Confucius justifying his refusal to take the easy way out, and with the recluses being made to look like lazy dropouts. After the encounter with the plowmen, for instance, Confucius sniffs, \u201cA person cannot flock together with the birds and the beasts\u201d (Location\u00a01400)\n- To begin with, unlike Confucius, Laozi thought that less, rather than more, culture was the answer. Confucius saw humans as fundamentally crude by nature and in need of cultivation. Laozi believed that we\u2019re fine as we are\u2014or at least as we were, before society messed us up. For Laozi, human nature is fundamentally good, and our innate dispositions are the ones we need to follow. Education and training are therefore entirely counterproductive, leading us away from our essential goodness. (Location\u00a01431)\n- Moreover, the very act of socially labeling things as \u201cbeautiful\u201d or \u201cgood,\u201d in Laozi\u2019s view, already distorts our natural, spontaneous judgment. One passage tells us that \u201cwhen everyone in the world knows that the beautiful is \u2018beautiful,\u2019 it is then ugly.\u201d What this cryptic claim might mean is spelled out by the rest of the passage, which argues that singling out and verbally labeling a value sets up a dichotomy that then acts as a mental trap. Laozi famously declared, \u201cHe who speaks does not know,\u201d a motto that underlines the tendency of verbal labels to cloud our judgment and our ability to see what is right in front of us. The philosophical target, of course, is the Confucians, with their clear standards concerning the right kind of music to listen to, the right kind of clothes to wear, the right way to enter a room, and\u2014perhaps most damaging\u2014the precise way to be \u201cgood.\u201d Laozi\u2019s argument is that calling some behavior \u201cgood\u201d ensures that it will not be good, because conscious labeling and explicit effort poison our experience.

Desire, in turn, is created and strengthened by the two activities so fundamental to the Confucian pursuit of wu-wei: cultural knowledge and active striving. Cultured tastes and artificial needs, he argues, distort our natural enjoyment of the world, and we can counter this by keeping our food simple and our physical desires modest. (Location\u00a01529)\n- The clearest account of how, in Laozi\u2019s view, conscious effort and striving are responsible for the world\u2019s ills is a famous passage that appears halfway through our received version of the text: The highest Virtue de] does not try to be virtuous, and so really possesses Virtue. The worst kind of Virtue never stops striving for Virtue, and so never achieves Virtue. The person of highest Virtue does not act [wu-wei] and does not reflect upon what he is doing. The person of highest benevolence acts, but does not reflect; The person of highest righteousness acts, and is full of self-consciousness. The person of highest ritual propriety acts and, when people do not respond, rolls up his sleeves and forces them to respond. Hence when the Way was lost there arose Virtue; When Virtue was lost there arose benevolence; When benevolence was lost there arose righteousness; When righteousness was lost there arose the Confucian rituals. Ritual is the wearing thin of loyalty and trust, And the beginning of disorder.

Vigorous physical activity puts enormous stress on the human body, and the body responds by temporarily shutting down parts deemed inessential, like our energy-hungry PFC. The cognitive state that results looks very much like the relaxed, natural wu-wei mind-set of the Laozian sage. As Dietrich observes, Some of the phenomenologically unique features of this state such as experiences of timelessness, living in the here and now, reduced awareness of one\u2019s surroundings, peacefulness (being less analytical), and floating (diminished working memory and attentional capacities), are consistent with a state of frontal hypofunction. Even abstruse feelings such as the unity with the self and/or nature might be more explicable, considering that the prefrontal cortex is the very structure that provides us with the ability to segregate, differentiate, and analyze the environment. (Location\u00a01648)\n- Interestingly, it appears that we get the same neurological pattern with the use of alcohol and various drugs, or a really good bout of sex, whether you prefer to play the role of the female or not. All of these activities temporarily shut down our conscious mind\u2014our sense of awareness, orientation, and control\u2014leaving the unconscious system in charge. When Laozi speaks of returning to the \u201cmind of an infant,\u201d this is, from a scientific perspective, more than just a metaphor. Laozian meditation aims to disable precisely the regions of the mind that are developed, or overdeveloped, in adulthood, allowing our more basic and ancient systems to take over. (Location\u00a01657)\n- As in the Analects, then, there is a political dimension to this vision. The de of the Laozian sage is so powerful that it is able to draw others into its orbit.

Dedicated to Confucian values, but drawn to the idea that wu-wei should spring from our innate tendencies rather than being forced upon us from the outside, Mencius formulated a unique version of Confucianism that is still very appealing today. Mencian thought attempted to chart a course between the traditionalism of Confucius and Xunzi and the radical primitivism of Laozi.

(Location\u00a01932)\n- This does not necessarily eliminate the need for instruction and training. As we\u2019ve discussed, the unconscious can be educated. We\u2019re not born knowing how to ride a bike or drive a car. In the same way, although we appear to be born with some nascent moral feelings, the behavior of your average three-year-old suggests that additional training and practice are required to become a mature person. This is the essence of Mencius\u2019s critique: you can\u2019t try to consciously force morality, like the sprout-pulling Mohists, but you also can\u2019t just sit around, listening to a Jerry Garcia solo and hoping socially desirable behavior will somehow magically follow. (Location\u00a01937)\n- benighted, (Location\u00a01951)\n- A dominant Laozian metaphor for naturalness is the uncarved block, a simple, unadorned, unworked chunk of wood. Mencius replaces this static metaphor with a dynamic one: nature is like a sprout that wants to grow in a certain direction, it just needs a little help. The primitive stasis that Laozi celebrates does not represent true naturalness but rather a stunting of natural human tendencies. (Location\u00a01952)\n- The difference is that Mencius believed that we are blessed with the beginnings of morally proper wu-wei within us\u2014the four sprouts. Although we are not spontaneously good when born, we tend toward good, in the same way that wheat sprouts will grow into mature plants if given the proper environment and care. Becoming spontaneously good involves merely developing these tendencies, under the guidance of a wise teacher, who plays the same role as a knowledgeable farmer. You need to apply fertilizer at the right times, weed when necessary, and ensure proper irrigation.

(Location\u00a02021)\n- Here again, Mencius seems prescient. The Mohists, like their modern utilitarian cousins, think that good behavior is the result of digital thinking. Your disembodied mind reduces the goods in the world to numerical values, does the math, and then imposes the results onto the body, which itself contributes nothing to the process. Mencius, on the contrary, is arguing that changing (Location\u00a02046)\n- your behavior is an analog process: education needs to be holistic, drawing upon your embodied experience, your emotions and perceptions, and employing imagistic reflection and extension as its main tools. Simply telling King Xuan of Qi that he ought to feel compassion for the common people doesn\u2019t get you very far. It would be similarly ineffective to ask him to reason abstractly about the illogical nature of caring for an ox while neglecting real live humans who are suffering as a result of his misrule. The only way to change his behavior\u2014to nudge his wu-wei tendencies in the right direction\u2014is to lead him through some guided exercises. We are analog beings living in an analog world. We think in images, which means that both learning and teaching depend fundamentally on the power of our imagination. (Location\u00a02048)\n- For both Xunzi and Confucius, wu-wei\u2014the complete absence of effort\u2014can be obtained only through an \u201caccumulation of effort.\u201d You pile effort on top of effort until what you\u2019ve learned becomes so internalized the effort falls away. The process involves hard work and a complete transformation of the self; as with carving a piece of jade or wood, the end product looks nothing like what you started with. The danger with this strategy, as we noted, is that it might not work.

Unlike the rigid conscious mind, it can \u201cdetermine right and wrong\u201d because it doesn\u2019t pre-determine it.

Use to the fullest what you have received from Heaven but do not think that you have gotten anything special. Just be empty, that is all. The Perfected Person uses his mind like a mirror: he does not lead or welcome; he responds but does not store. This is why he is able to win over things and not be harmed. (Location\u00a02508)\n- A literal mirror passively reflects what is in front of it, and when that thing changes the mirror changes as well. It does not \u201cstore\u201d past images, nor does it anticipate images to come. It simply waits, empty and receptive. This is what the post-fast consciousness looks like, open to the world, responding directly from the unconscious mind, and overflowing with subtle, but powerful, de. (Location\u00a02511)\n- To understand his point, take a simple economic transaction. Let\u2019s say I promise you five chickens in return for working all week on my farm and then give you only three. If you are a purely rational agent, you\u2019ll take the three chickens and go on your way. Why? The risk of getting killed or seriously injured in a fight is not worth two chickens. Unfortunately, in acting as a purely rational agent, you\u2019d turn yourself into an economic punching bag. Why would I give you what I promised when I know you\u2019ll take less and meekly slink off? Now, imagine that, instead, you are prone to righteous indignation. If I try to shortchange you on the chickens, I know you\u2019re going to fly off the handle and do something violent\u2014something irrationally violent. A person like you is going to tend to get the number of chickens originally promised. We no longer tend to denominate our transactions in chickens, but the logic here is identical to the Ultimatum Game we discussed earlier. If I am given $100 to split between you and me, and I offer you $1 and propose to keep $99 for myself, you will get angry and scupper the whole deal, even though the rational thing to do would be to take the $1.

Frank is keenly interested in this tension and even refers to it as a \u201csimple paradox\u201d\u2014one that is structurally the same as Nivison\u2019s paradox of virtue. Our long-term interests require trust between individuals, but trust can be acquired only by those who give up the direct pursuit of self-interest. The conscious pursuit of self-interest is actually incompatible with its attainment. Similarly, in the context of civilization, moral emotions are the key to people obtaining maximum material advantage, but they work only if they are sincere. We couldn\u2019t hope for a clearer analysis of the paradox lurking at the heart of any kind of social commitment, whether the Shang king\u2019s willingness to take on his wife\u2019s sickness or seven-year-old Ivy\u2019s sincerity (or lack thereof) in feeling love for all living creatures.

This is not the way we normally tell stories, so being forced to do it increases cognitive load. Dishonest suspects, it turns out, are less effective liars if you handicap their conscious minds in this way. (Location\u00a02939)\n- This reverse-order alibi technique is a great tool for law enforcement but not terribly practical when evaluating a potential business partner or deciding if the people you\u2019re about to make a peace treaty with are being sincere. There are other ways to achieve the same effect, though. The police study aimed to reduce subjects\u2019 cognitive control ability by increasing the load\u2014adding more weight, as it were. Alternately, you can keep the load constant but decrease cognitive control ability\u2014weaken the mental muscles\u2014by suppressing cognitive control centers. One way to do this is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which involves applying a powerful magnetic force to the appropriate region of the skull. TMS, however, is a very recent technology and not exactly widely available. Also, in most cultures it\u2019s considered bad form to shock the heads of new acquaintances with huge magnets.

Confucius advises that, when judging the character of someone, you should pay attention to their eyes, their offhand remarks, their subtle body language, especially when they think that no one else is around. If you do that, he says, \u201chow can a person\u2019s true character hide?\u201d (Location\u00a02995)\n- The key is to see that, at the end of the day, it is not enough that a trusted member of our group is able to dance our dances, drink wine with us, and speak our language well, although that certainly doesn\u2019t hurt. Indeed, as we\u2019ve seen, such relatively unfakeable markers are probably very useful for quick Is he one of us? assessments. At the end of the day, though, we need more. Because of the constant danger of free riders faking commitment\u2014putting in the time to learn our cultural skills, while secretly ready to betray our shared values as soon as an opportunity presents itself\u2014a potential gap opens between external behavior and internal motivation. What we want, then, is a particular type of desirable, hot behavior where there is absolutely no gap between action and motivation. We want to assure ourselves that there is no extraneous cold cognition sneaking around backstage with potentially nefarious plans of its own. What we\u2019re interested in is not mere physical skills but what philosophers call \u201cvirtues\u201d: stable dispositions to perform socially desirable actions in a manner that\u2019s sincerely motivated by shared values. (Location\u00a03038)\n- We have a powerful, ineradicable intuition that a \u201ccompassionate\u201d action performed without the right motivation is merely a semblance, a counterfeit of virtue. The flip side is that evidence of sincerity and spontaneity in the moral realm inspires and moves us. (Location\u00a03066)\n- Interestingly, the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle was very much aware of this issue, which he framed in terms of a distinction between physical skills (what he called \u201ccrafts\u201d) and virtues. When it comes to a skill like playing the piano, we have no problem imagining how forced training can eventually result in an internalized, reliable skill. (Location\u00a03068)\n- When it comes to a virtue like compassion, however, it\u2019s not at all clear how training alone could work. We have an intuition that, if I don\u2019t spontaneously feel at least some compassion for the homeless guy with the blistered feet, going through the motions of buying him new boots is not going to transform me into a compassionate person. Even if I force myself to act out compassionate behaviors hundreds of times, as if practicing scales, it\u2019s hard to see how or when I would thereby become a genuinely compassionate person. There\u2019s an important sense in which character virtues strike us as the kind of thing that can\u2019t be acquired just by trying: either you have them or you don\u2019t. (Location\u00a03072)\n- They want to foster cooperation and virtue, not efficient butchery. So the paradox exists because the kinds of virtues that people care about and value in others center on who you are, not necessarily what you do.

They are about stable, inner states, not just outward behavior. They are about values, not merely actions, because it\u2019s commitment to shared values that allows large-scale societies to function. So it\u2019s not enough to perform generous actions, you need to become a generous person. This is an enormously difficult trick to pull off, which is why true wu-wei is both inherently hard to reach and such a great signal of trustworthiness once we\u2019ve managed to get there. We\u2019re attracted to genuinely wu-wei people\u2014they have de\u2014because evolution has shaped us to home in on signals of sincerity that are difficult to consciously simulate and even harder to experience on demand, and to do so in response to basic challenges inherent to human cooperation. (Location\u00a03079)\n- Fortunately for us, the early Chinese explored every conceivable strategy for moving a person from a state of alienated trying into perfected wu-wei. You can carve and polish: subject yourself to rigorous, long-term training designed to eventually instill the right dispositions. You can embrace simplicity: actively reject the pursuit of goals, in the hope that the goals will then be obtained by themselves. You can cultivate your sprouts: try to identify incipient tendencies of desirable behavior within you, and then nurture and expand them until they are strong enough to take over. Or you can just go with the flow: forget about trying, forget about not trying, and just let the values that you want to embrace pick you up and carry you along. (Location\u00a03108)\n- \u201cWhen any\u00a0\u2026\u00a0act of charity or of gratitude, for instance, is presented to our sight of imagination, we are deeply impressed with its beauty and feel a strong desire in ourselves of doing charitable and grateful acts also. On the contrary, when we see or read of any atrocious deed, we are disgusted with its deformity, and conceive an abhorrence of vice. Now every emotion of this kind is an exercise of our virtuous dispositions, and dispositions, like limbs of the body, acquire strength by exercise.\u201d Just as the four limbs of the body are strengthened by exercise, so are the four sprouts of proper wu-wei behavior nourished by the imaginative workout provided by literature. One wonders if Jefferson had been reading Mencius. (Location\u00a03276)\n- It\u2019s in these situations\u2014when the pressure is on and the stakes are high\u2014that Zhuangzi\u2019s letting-go strategy really shines. Woodcarver Qing has to engage in a weeklong ritual before he can successfully forget his body and focus his skill on the environment, and elsewhere there are suggestions that seated meditation and breathing practices are involved. It is likely that these Zhuangzian exemplars are engaged in something that looks more like the \u201cobjectless\u201d meditation practiced in Zen, Zhuangzi\u2019s direct religious heirs, than the visualization practices of Tibetan Buddhism. Objectless meditation typically involves assuming a simple, stable posture and then trying to empty your mind through focusing on your breath or a fixed feature in the environment.
